# [DRAFT] Filtering RESTfull JSON view with Spring
This is the code from this blog post [not finished yet] https://samkruglov.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/json-filtering-with-spring/

Execute `mvn spring-boot:run` on the root to start the application. Requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

This branch defines the base workspace while other represent ways of filtering JSON view in a RESTful API.
